# Dufus ATM

## Synopsis
This project is targeted at educational institutions. By targeting students and new programmers, the project can provide an intuitive learning tool. The user interface will be designed to be straightforward and easy to navigate, making it appealing to all users. What sets this ATM software apart from existing solutions is its focus on modularity and extensibility. Through the use of distinct account objects, I aim to make account creation and balance management easy. This project will enable users to create and manage multiple account types, such as savings, checking, and business accounts, each with its own set of functionalities.

## Motivation
This project was developed for my Object Oriented Programming course at Southwest Technical College.

## How to Run
All of the .java files are required to run the program. The program can be ran through ATMInterface.java, using the javac command on command prompt. 

## Contributors
Anyone who wishes to build upon this is more than welcome. I need help with saving data, and input validation.
